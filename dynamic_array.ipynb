    "    \"# Dynamic Arrays: A Simple Data Structure\\n\",\n",
    "    \"These notes will supplement section 17.4 of CLRS book, which covers a lot more than this chapter.\\n\",\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \"A dynamic array is simply an array but it can grow in size to accomodate new elements that are added. \\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"## Arrays \\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"An array is a \\\"contiguous chunk\\\" of random access memory in a computer.  \\n\",\n",
    "    \"  - Random Access: We can access the individual cells of the array as `a[1]`, `a[2]`, ..., `a[n]`, where  $n$ is the size of the array. \\n\",\n",
    "    \"  - Reading or writing to the memory element at index `j`  takes $O(1)$ time. \\n\",\n",
    "    \"  \\n\",\n",
    "    \"Our goal is to maintain an array of $n$ elements and support the following operations:\\n\",\n",
    "    \"  - Reading/Writing to a particular index $j$ where $1 \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"  - Adding a new element at the end of the array: the size of the array will become $n+1$ as a result.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"  \\n\",\n",
    "    \"  \\n\",\n",
    "    \"## Memory Allocator\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"The main difficulty in implementing an array data structure lies in how a process in a computer obtains memory. In all computer operating systems there is a memory management module that allocates memory to running programs. Programs can request a \\\"contiguous chunk\\\" of $k$ memory cells using an \\\"allocation\\\" function. This function is setup differently in various programming languages. For instance, in python, we can allocate an array of size `k` all initialized with $0$s as follows:\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"~~~\\n\",\n",
    "    \"a = [0]* k\\n\",\n",
    "    \"~~~\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"Note however, that lists in python are already a \\\"dynamic array\\\" implemented more or less in the same manner that we are going to describe here. \\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3917574/how-is-pythons-list-implemented\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"The curious reader may ask about \\\"deallocation\\\" or \\\"freeing\\\" memory. We note that \\n\",\n",
    "    \"in some programming environments like C/C++ this is required for the program to explicitly tell the operating system that a particular chunk of memory that was previously allocated is no longer needed. However, python is a _garbage collected_ language. I.e, the python runtime manages memory and decides that a chunk of memory is no longer needed/can be freed. The details of garbage collection are beyond the scope of this course. \"\n",
